        <h2 id="assisi">Prayer St. Francis of Assisi</h2>
		<p>St. Francis' prayer is the following:</p>
        <p>Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;
where there is darkness, light;
where there is sadness, joy...
For it is in giving that we receive...
</p>
<p>
<b>To enact this in your life, use the following memory technique:</b>
</p>
<p>Think of a room in your home and choose two of it's walls.  Imagine one wall has a water drop, fire, and broken stick on it.  This represents sadness, hatred, and injury.  This reminds you to keep an eye out for people who are sad, angry, or injured.  When you spot someone in that situation you look to help them: for sadness try to bring them joy or hope with your words, for anger sow love, and for injury try to suggest they pardon the person who injured them.</p>
<p>For the second wall, imagine darkness, followed by a bright cross, as well as a present.  This will remind you to look for people or situations that are dark and to bring light to it (darkness).  Also, to find those who doubt, help them to have faith (the bright cross represents faith here), and the present is a reminder to give.

<h2 id="commands">Jesus' Commands</h2>
		<p>Choose 3 rooms in your house.  Choose a starting direction, say north for the sake of example.  Start in the first room, north is room 1, location 1, the corner in the northeast is room 1, location 2, keep spinning around for all 4 walls and 4 corners making locations 1-8.  The ceiling is location 9 and the floor is location 10.  This way you have the ability to memorize 30 of Jesus' commands in one room (each location memorizes 3 commands)</p>
