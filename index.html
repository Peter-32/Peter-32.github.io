<p>
I'm a senior data scientist working at Optum, a business platform of United Health Group.
</p>

<p>
A data scientist does five things in this order of priority.  I primarily do number two, but am capable to do any of them from scratch:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>A/B Testing on websites.</li>
	<li>Work with lists of millions of entities to place them into two groups: profitable or unprofitable.</li>
	<li>Ensure data is sampled randomly and recorded for use.  Choosing samples based on ease, or based on decisions of yourself or the sample are discouraged, but sometimes acceptable.</li>
	<li>KPI Dashboards for sales funnels and customer retention.</li>
	<li>Give customer support website tools to solve customer issues.</li>
</ol>

<p>
I have done data science professionally for <span id="days_in_data_science"></span> days.
</p>

<p>
My skills are machine learning, product analytics, data management, distributed computing, cloud computing, natural language processing, and deep learning.
You can <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yc2rtelon7hyq12/DataScienceEbook_04_2023.pdf?dl=0">download my book for free here</a>.
</p>

<p>The best skills you can learn from my book are: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>How to have your code run fast and be organized.  Without this knowledge, you'll likely have Spark programs that require 100-500GB and run extremely slowly.  With this knowledge, you can sort millions of entities into profitable or unprofitable with only 500 MB of memory and running very fast.</li>
	<li>The 45 steps to follow to complete a machine learning project.</li>
	<li>Avoid overpaying by millions of dollars on cloud computing (In my experience, I've seen data science models cost $1 million a year, but rewrote it to run for free on existing resources, or could be run for around $50 a year otherwise).</li>
	<li>Suggestions on analytic database design, all components of A/B testing, and making website tools/dashboards.</li>
</ol>


<p>
I'm working on the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program and have <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p1nuT2hK4V46-FPYua5hyv-yil8eXW5vOGcGNXnxlZQ/edit?usp=sharing">my notes available here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Also, I wrote a short ebook on the topic: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/chny26ce6kjbpyq/Data%20Science%20Framework.pdf?dl=0">An Effective Data Science Framework</a>.
</p>

<p>The methods I use often create models that are 10x more profitable than existing models, are easy to read, are easy to improve, and sometimes only take 1-3 days to create compared to the usual time of 1 year.
