<h3>Intro</h3>
<h4>Essential Basics and Definitions</h4>
<ul>

	<li>Table - Has records and fields (rows/columns) similar to an Excel worksheet.</li>
	<li>Field - A column in a table, similar to a field in an object in an OO language like Java.</li>
	<li>Record - A row in a table, similar to an instance of an object in an OO language like Java.</li>
	<li>A database can have many tables.</li>
	<li>Query - A question you ask the database that will return records and fields (rows/columns).</li>
	<li>Filter - Used to determine the subset of the records (rows) you'd like to use.</li>
	<li>Alias - The new name you give a field (column).</li>
	<li>Raw data - The form the data is in when it reaches you.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Common Data Types</h4>
<ul>
	<li>String</li>
	<li>Integer</li>
	<li>Boolean</li>
	<li>Date</li>
	<li>Timestamp</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting Data</h3>
<blockquote><p>Create, read, update, and delete are four basic functions of persistent storage (Wikipedia)</p></blockquote>
<p>
To read data from the database, you decide the subset of records and fields you want to use in one or many tables.
The subset of records might be all records within a date range where one field has a certain value.
To get a subset of records you use a filter, as previously mentioned.
The subset of fields you want can be found by first exploring the tables available to you.
To explore data, these two commands are both useful:
</p>
<p class="coding">
SELECT * FROM yourTableNameHere;<br>
DESCRIBE yourTableNameHere;
</p>
<p>
To read from a table you type the table name after the FROM reserved keyword.
To read certain columns you type the column names after the SELECT reserved keyword.
All columns selected must be separated by a comma.
To read all columns use the * symbol instead of column names.
To give a column an alias (renaming a column), type the new alias after the column selected.
You can apply operations on columns within records like "+" to do addition.
</p>
<p class="coding">
SELECT order_id, item_name, price+tax total_price<br>
FROM orders
</p>
<h3>Filtering</h3>
<p>
The code above selects from the "orders" table, reads columns order_id, item_name, and price plus tax, and renames the last selection as total_price.
The next concept to learn is the WHERE keyword, which applies filtering.
</p>
<p class="coding">
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE last_name = 'Johnson' and first_name = 'Mark'
</p>
<p>
This filters for records where the last name is Johnson and first name is Mark.
</p>
<table>
<tr>
	<th>Name</th>
	<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>AND</td>
	<td>allows another boolean.  Both statements must be true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>OR</td>
	<td>allows another boolean.  Only one of the statements must be true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>=</td>
	<td>equal to</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>&gt;</td>
	<td>greater than</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>&gt;=</td>
	<td>greater than or equal to</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>&lt;</td>
	<td>less than</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>&lt;=</td>
	<td>less than or equal to</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>!=</td>
	<td>not equal to</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>between _ and _</td>
	<td>between a range (replace the _)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>is null</td>
	<td>the column is an empty null value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>is not null</td>
	<td>the column is not an empty null value</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="coding">
SELECT supplier_id FROM suppliers WHERE supplier_name != 'Apple' OR supplier_id BETWEEN 250 and 1000;<br>
SELECT * FROM spupliers WHERE (state = 'Florida' AND supplier_name = 'IBM') OR supplier_id > 5000;<br>
SELECT supplier_id FROM suppliers WHERE supplier_name is not null;
</p>
<h3>Segmenting Data</h3>
<p>
The GROUP BY reserved keyword will allow us to segment out our data.
Using all the data in the student table, we want to calculate the average scores of each student.
</p>
<p class="coding">
SELECT student_name, AVG(test_score) GPA FROM student GROUP BY student_name;
</p>
<ul>
	<li>SUM - Used to add the values together to get a total</li>
	<li>COUNT(*) - Used to get the record count</li>
	<li>AVG - Used to get the SUM divided by the COUNT(*)</li>
	<li>MAX - maximum value</li>
	<li>MIN - minimum value</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can limit the results returned with the LIMIT keyword.  Many keywords are optional, but you
must use them in the correct order: SELECT / FROM / WHERE / GROUP BY / ORDER BY / LIMIT.
</p>
<h3>INNER JOINS</h3>
<p>
The INNER JOIN keyword lets you use two tables at once.
You use this keyword after the FROM keyword, but before the WHERE keyword.
You are joining the two tables together, usually where two values match up.
</p>
<h3>IF, CASE, and Other Functions</h3>
<p>
SQL has IF/ELSE IF/ELSE or switch statements using the CASE and IF keywords.  Here are some examples:
</p>
<p class="coding">
  CASE<br>
    WHEN grade = 100 THEN 'A+'<br>
    WHEN grade > 90 THEN 'A'<br>
    WHEN grade > 80 THEN 'B'<br>
    WHEN grade > 70 THEN 'C'<br>
    WHEN grade > 60 THEN 'D'<br>
    ELSE 'F' END<br>
   <br>
SELECT IF(1>2,2,3);<br>
        -> 3    <br>
</p>

<p>
These are some date and string functions
</p>
<p class="coding">

MONTH(date1)<br>
Returns the month of date1<br>
 <br>
YEAR(date1)<br>
Returns the year of date1<br>
 <br>
now()<br>
Returns the current time in timestamp format<br>
 <br>
curdate()<br>
Returns the current time in date format<br>
 <br>
date(date1) or to_date(date1)<br>
Converts a timestamp format to a date format        <br>


<br>
mysql> SELECT CONCAT('My', 'S', 'QL');<br>
        -> 'MySQL'<br>
mysql> SELECT CONCAT('My', NULL, 'QL');<br>
        -> NULL<br>
mysql> SELECT CONCAT(14.3);<br>
        -> '14.3'<br>



 <br>
mysql> SELECT SUBSTRING('Quadratically',5);<br>
        -> 'ratically'<br>
mysql> SELECT SUBSTRING('Quadratically',5,6);<br>
        -> 'ratica'<br>




 <br>
mysql> SELECT LPAD('9',2,'0');<br>
        -> '09'
</p>
<p>
Other important topics are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>UNION ALL joins records from one query with records from a second query</li>
	<li>Subqueries	Queries within queries, like inception        </li>
	<li>LEFT JOINS</li>
</ul>


<h2><a id="four_steps">Four steps to writing SQL</a></h2>
<ol>
	<li>Aggregate - Return a single value per unique value.</li>
	<li>Join - Combine rows from two or more tables.</li>
	<li>Filter - Using the WHERE reserved keyword</li>
	<li>Specifics - fine tune your SQL</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>Step one</strong>, aggregate, is deciding what you want to be grouped together, you don't even have to type anything yet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Step two</strong>, join, collects your data together and can be done with an INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL JOIN.
At this point, you should do the following:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ask yourself <strong>which</strong> tables contain the data I need?</li>
	<li>Ask yourself <strong>how</strong> do I join these tables together?</li>
	<li>Then type it out.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>Step three</strong>, filter, involves using the WHERE clause.  Just chain together boolean statements
to get the subset of records you want.  You chain these together with the AND and OR reserved keywords.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>last step</strong>, specifics, puts it all together.  Do these things:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Type out the columns you want to grab, with or without functions applied to them</li>
	<li>Optionally add the GROUP BY reserved keyword now in the right spot.</li>
	<li>Optionally add the HAVING statement.</li>
	<li>Optionally add the ORDER BY statement and LIMIT statement.</li>
</ol>
<p>
You can apply functions to data.
Some important ones are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>DATE - get the date of a timestamp.</li>
	<li>CONCAT - join two strings together.</li>
	<li>CAST - change the data type.</li>
	<li>MAX, MIN, SUM, COUNT - used to carry out aggregation (Step 1 above).</li>
	<li>SUBSTRING - get a substring.</li>
	<li>TRIM - remove white space.</li>
	<li>TIMESTAMPDIFF - get the difference between two timestamps.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="impala_analytic_functions">Impala Analytic Functions</a></h2>
<h3>Problem with regular MySQL</h3>
<ul>
<li>Obtaining aggregated data in a query involves losing the granular data.</li>
<li>You may have to ask the database multiple times to regain the granular data.</li>
<li>Difficult to mix aggregations with granular data</li>
<li>Only one group by statement is allowed per result</li>
<li>Getting running totals or running averages</li>
<li>Difficult to obtain chronological data or row count.  ie. Stock prices: Current value, LAG(1), LAG(2), LAG(3), ....</li>
<li>Windowing can be used, but may require 3 calls against a temporary table</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mix aggregated and granular data without losing granular data</li>
<li>Call many GROUP BY statements in each result</li>
<li>Impala queries can interact with other rows without losing granularity</li>
<li>Customize your partition and ordering and grab data from a row adjacent +/- n rows away</li>
<li>Customize your partition and ordering and grab all adjacent +/- n rows</li>
<li>Rankings and row count built in</li>
<li>Fraud detection: Multiple purchases in window from IP and click/action performance spikes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<ul>
<li>OVER(partition by column1 order by column2 rows between [n preceding|current row|unbounded preceding] and  [n following|current row |unbounded following])</li>
<li>Compatible with standard aggregate functions: MAX(), SUM(), and COUNT()</li>
<li>Compatible with new Impala analytic functions</li>
<li>All Impala analytic functions allow grandular data to appear with aggregated data</li>
<li>ROW_NUMBER, DENSE_RANK(), RANK()</li>
<li>All perform counting and are similar</li>
<li>FIRST_VALUE(), LAST_VALUE()</li>
<li>Unsure of the value added over using MAX()</li>
<li>LEAD(), LAG()</li>
<li>Used to look ahead or behind at one row at a time</li>
<li>GROUP BY keyword doesn’t work in the subquery using these functions</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="tips_for_writing_sql">Tips for Writing SQL</a></h2>
<ul>
	<li>When joining subqueries, group by the columns used in the ON clause and only those columns, otherwise you may duplicate data from the first subquery
if you use a LEFT JOIN.</li>
	<li>A LEFT JOIN can be used similar to a VLOOKUP in Excel.</li>
	<li>Many errors involve omission of a comma or an extra comma.</li>
	<li>Break problems down into smaller problems.</li>
	<li>For optimal performance, filter the data using the columns from the largest table and apply as many filters as possible in the joins to help find the data.
	Do function operations after most of the aggregation has occurred by using a subquery.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="common_methods_solve_problems">Common Methods to Solve Problems</a></h2>
<p>
There are two methods to try if you start to feel overwhelmed with a problem.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Get all the data and return a result set, then write a query against that result set, repeat as many times as necessary.  The final query has many nested subqueries.</li>
	<li>Many different subqueries joined together with LEFT JOINS or FULL OUTER JOINS.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Below is an example of the second method, which can also be done with FULL OUTER JOINS:
</p>
<p class="coding">
SELECT<br>
a.col1,<br>
a.col2,<br>
a.col3,<br>
a.clicks,<br>
b.revenue<br>
FROM<br>
(<br>
col1,<br>
col2,<br>
col3,<br>
SUM(clicks) AS clicks<br>
FROM table1<br>
GROUP BY 1,2,3<br>
) a<br>
LEFT JOIN<br>
(<br>
select<br>
col1,<br>
col2,<br>
col3,<br>
SUM(revenue) AS revenue<br>
FROM table2<br>
GROUP BY 1,2,3<br>
) b ON<br>
a.col1=b.col1<br>
and a.col2=b.col2<br>
and a.col3=b.col3
